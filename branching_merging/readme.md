# Git Branching + Merging Exercise

### Part I 

Answer the following questions:

- What does `git clean` do?
- What do the `-d and -f` flags for `git clean` do?
- What `git` command creates a branch?
- What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
- What `git` command changes to another branch?
- How do you remove **modified or deleted** files from the working directory?
- What `git` command deletes a branch?
- What does the `git diff` command do?
- How do you remove files from the staging area?
- How do merge conflicts happen?

### Part II

Create your own merge conflict! Work on the same file on two separate branches and merge the two branches together. Fix the conflicts and finish your merge. In the real world you will never intentionally try to create merge conflicts, but it is important to understand how and why they are created. Most importantly, it's important not to be intimidated by merge conflicts, and to be able to fix them with confidence!
