# Advanced Git Exercise

### Part I 

Answer the following questions:

- What is the difference between `git reset` and `git revert`. When would you use one over the other?
- What is the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`. When would you use one over the other?
- What is the difference between `git stash pop` and `git stash apply`. When would you use one over the other?
- What kinds of things can you do in `interactive` mode when rebasing?

### Part II

It's time to practice some more with everything you have learned. 

- Create a local repository from the command line.
- Add and commit files.
- Push your repository up to GitHub.
- Fork and Clone [https://github.com/rithmschool/learn_forking](https://github.com/rithmschool/learn_forking).
- Add and commit some changes and submit a PR.
- Change to a different branch and add some files and merge into master when you are done.
- Practice using `revert` to undo commits and `rebase` with interactive mode for a better commit history.
- Submit another pull request, with squashed commits.
